/* The "Red Heart ❤️" character consists of 2 codepoints.
   The first codepoint (U+2764) is the black heart "❤" character.
   The second codepoint (U+FE0F) is the VARIATION SELECTOR-16 character.
   The second codepoint is also an "unassigned" character.
   
   Depending on the terminal, unassigned characters may be replaced
   by blank characters "".
   So, it may cause a bug where all the characters to the right of the
   rightmost red heart character shift to the left by 1.
   
   To avoid this, I have replaced the space to the right of the Red Heart
   with an invisible character, which can be found in Unicode.txt */
