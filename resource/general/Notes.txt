/* The "Red Heart ❤️" character consists of 2 codepoints.
   The first codepoint (U+2764) is the (heavy) black heart character "❤".
   The second codepoint (U+FE0F) is the VARIATION SELECTOR-16 character,
   which is an "unassigned" character.
   
   Depending on the terminal, unassigned characters may be replaced
   with blank characters "".
   So, it may cause a bug where all the characters to the right of the
   rightmost red heart character shift to the left by the number of red hearts.
   
   To avoid this, I have replaced the space to the right of the rightmost red
   heart with an invisible character, which can be found in Unicode.txt */

/* On some terminals, a call to refresh() is required before using curs_set(0)
   to make the cursor invisible */
